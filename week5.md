Week 5 – Security and Monitoring

What I learned

Why system monitoring is important for security

The role of logs in detecting suspicious activities

How monitoring improves system reliability

What I did

Learned about system logs and monitoring concepts

Understood how administrators track system performance and security events

Reviewed how monitoring helps identify potential threats early

Reflection
