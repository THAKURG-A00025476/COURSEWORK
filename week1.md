Title

Week 1 – System Planning

System Overview

In this coursework, I am using Ubuntu Linux running in VirtualBox as my operating system.
The system is managed using the command-line interface without relying on a graphical desktop.
This setup helps me understand how operating systems are configured and administered in real-world server environments.

System Architecture

The system is installed as a virtual machine using VirtualBox.
This allows me to safely experiment with operating system configuration, security, and performance without affecting my main computer.
All tasks are performed directly on the Ubuntu system using the terminal.

Activities Completed This Week

During Week 1, I focused on planning the system and becoming familiar with the Linux environment.
I explored basic system information such as the operating system version, hardware resources, storage usage, and network configuration.
This helped me understand how the operating system interacts with hardware components.

Commands Explored

This week, I explored basic Linux commands to gather system information, including commands to check:

Current user

System name

Kernel and operating system version

Memory usage

Disk usage

Network interfaces

These commands are essential for system administration and troubleshooting.

Reflection

Week 1 helped me build a foundation for the rest of the coursework.
By using the terminal to explore system information, I gained a better understanding of how an operating system manages hardware resources.
This knowledge will be important when configuring security settings and analysing system performance in later weeks.

This screenshot shows the output of the uname -a command, which provides detailed information about the Linux kernel version, system architecture, and operating system being used.
