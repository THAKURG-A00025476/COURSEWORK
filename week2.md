Title

Week 2 – Security Planning

Content to write

Operating Systems security is an essential part of system administration.
In this week, I learned about basic security concepts and why planning security early is important.

What I learned

The importance of user authentication and authorization

The difference between regular users and root user

Common security threats such as weak passwords and unauthorized access

Why least privilege is important in operating systems

What I did

Reviewed Linux user roles and permissions

Learned how system access can be controlled using users and groups

Understood how poor security configuration can expose a system to attacks

Reflection
This week helped me understand that security is not only about installing tools but also about planning.
I learned that even a simple mistake, such as using weak passwords or giving too many permissions, can cause serious security issues.
This knowledge is important for managing Linux systems safely.
