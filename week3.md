Title

Week 3 – Application Selection

What I learned

The importance of selecting appropriate applications for an operating system

Differences between open-source and proprietary software

Why package management is important in Linux

What I did

Explored Linux package managers such as APT

Learned how applications are installed, updated, and removed

Compared lightweight and heavy applications based on system resources

Reflection
This week showed me how choosing the right applications can improve system performance and security.
I learned that unnecessary software increases attack surface and resource usage.
Selecting only required applications is an important responsibility of a system administrator.

This command displays a list of installed packages managed by the APT package manager.
It helped me understand how software is managed and installed on Ubuntu systems.

This command shows detailed information about the Bash shell, including its version, dependencies, and description.
Bash is a core command-line application required for system interaction.

This command shows the installed size of the Bash application.
Understanding application size is important when selecting lightweight software for performance and storage efficiency.

This command checks whether Snap-related services are installed.
Snap packages are generally heavier than traditional APT packages, which can affect system performance on low-resource systems.
