Title

Week 6 – Performance Testing

What I learned

The importance of testing system performance

Key performance indicators such as CPU, memory, and disk usage

How performance affects user experience

What I did

Learned how system resources are measured

Observed how running applications affect system performance

Understood how performance testing helps optimize systems

Reflection
This week helped me understand how system performance impacts reliability.
I learned that monitoring performance helps prevent system slowdowns and crashes.
Performance testing is necessary for maintaining a stable system.

This command shows how long the system has been running and the system load averages. Load averages indicate how busy the CPU has been over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

This command displays disk usage information. Monitoring disk space is important to ensure the system performs efficiently without running out of storage.<img width="846" height="131" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-18 141836" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/512b722e-f113-47b7-84b1-96dc4e4cd9b3" />

This command tests disk read speed and caching performance. Disk speed directly affects system responsiveness and application performance.
